# Wired-Regex-tutorial

Regex, short for regular expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. It can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern, to replace parts of a string based on the pattern, or to split a string into an array of substrings. It could also be likened to having the key to a cypher. As a cypher key decrypts a coded message, revealing its content. A regex deciphers the 'coded' patterns that are within the text, identifying and extracting data that matches those patterns. It can find and unlock detailed patterns that aren't immedialtely apparent, such as specific sequences of characters, formatting, or data structures. And just as a cypher key is desighned for a specific code, a regex too is crafted for specfic patterns. The precision of a regex allows you to target exactly what it is you are looking for within a text. You could target a particular word, a format like an email address, or a more complex pattern like dates in various formats, and more!

## Summary

In this tutorial, I will be explaining the functionality of a Regex expression to help myself and others knowledge on the subject. In this tutorial we are going to narrow in on the example of Charaacter name validation in an MMORPG. For example, a name validation Regex could ensure that a character name starts with a letter, and can include letters, apostrophies, and spaces, with a total lengh of up to 20 characters. Here is Regex pattern that could do this: 
 `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z' ]{0,19}$`
